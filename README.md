# Encryption-Files


Put together programs

Itll ask if you want to Encrypt or Decrypt

If encrypt..itll ask for your input then run the input on programs #1 then #2, then #3...then output the phrase in gibberish Encrypted

If Decrypt...itll ask for your input and then run numbers #3B #2B #1B and then output the phrase

The code in numbered in github.
Feel free to ask any questions.



Hey guys! ive been working on an Encryption/Decryption project and im finally done with the 3 different pieces of code to do so. 

1st one: http://i.imgur.com/uML0tJK.gif Uses "mirrors" to change letters.(this requires you to call a key file--ive saved it here)

2nd one. Checks the input and every time it finds a consonant (vowels stay the same) it adds an 'o' and the same consonant. EX: Hello becomes Hohelollol.

3rd. Simple, it changes the ascii value of each letter by adding 2 and changing the letter.

(All codes change an inputed phrase and output its encryption version.)


Problem here is, ive created 3 separate projects and i need help putting them together into one program. 

Ill be supplying the code for the three but really need help with the rest. Ive gave it a try and i havent gotten anywhere. Any help would be amazing! 

What im trying to accomplish
-Ask the user if they would like to Encrypt or Decrypt.
-If encrypt..you run the 3 Encryption programs in that order(#1,#2,#3). and output the gibberish.
-If Decrypt....your run the 3 codes to Decrypt(#3B,#2B, #1B in this order)  and returns the original message.
